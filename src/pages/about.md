## The Site

Welcome to Queer Jews. We're here to help you find your person (or people!). 

Inspired by old-school personal ad culture and its modern descendants like Lex and Hey Alma Classifieds, Queer Jews provides a low-fi, text-only space for queer Jews to connect. Personal ads have been used by the LGBTQ+ community for decades as a means of finding one another, especially in times or places when in-person queer connections can be hard to come by.

We're ad-free, payment-free, and feature-light by design. 

Whatever we build is by Jewish queers, for Jewish queers. ❤︎

Tell your friends about us! (Assuming they're nice. :) ) More people = higher chance of connections.

## The Shadchan

Queer Jews is built by [Shir Goldberg](https://shirgoldberg.com/). Hi! 

I'm a queer & trans Jew living in NYC. I've spent a long time developing an intentional approach to finding relationships and community, and feel incredibly blessed to have gotten what I was looking for. Now, my mission in life is to share the love and good mazel with everyone else.

As my friends will tell you, there's nothing I find more fun than figuring out the perfect match for someone. Whether it's connecting you to a potential new friend, niche Jewish WhatsApp group, or maybe even your bashert (IY"H!), I'm excited to learn more about you and how I can help.
